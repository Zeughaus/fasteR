# fasteR
Fast Lane to Learning R!

This is a companion site to [Norman Matloff’s repo “fasteR”](https://github.com/matloff/fasteR#faster-fast-lane-to-learning-r). 
It contains challenges and additional materials developed for an 
introductory course on data science, first taught at Lyon College in fall 2021. 
At the same time, I’m using this project to teach myself the use of 
GitHub in the classroom.

I haven't decided yet if I want to publish these as "pages" or as a regular repo. The advantage of the gh-pages approach is, I suppose, that I don't have to merge it back into the code base of fasteR but instead the students can try it out first.
