## Welcome to fasteR - The Fast Lane to Learning R!

This is a companion site to [Norman Matloff's repo "fasteR"](https://github.com/matloff/fasteR#faster-fast-lane-to-learning-r). It contains challenges and additional materials developed for an introductory course on data science, first taught at Lyon College in fall 2021. At the same time, I'm using this project to teach myself the use of GitHub in the classroom.
